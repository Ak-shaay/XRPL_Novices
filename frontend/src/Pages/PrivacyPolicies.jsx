          </h3>
          <p>
            We value your privacy and understand the importance of anonymity in
            reporting sensitive incidents. To protect your identity and ensure
            that your report remains confidential:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Anonymous submissions:</strong> You are not required to
              provide any personal information when submitting a report.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No tracking of personal data:</strong> We do not collect
              or store any personal information related to your identity, such
              as your name, email address, or location, unless you voluntarily
              provide it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Secure system:</strong> We use a secure reporting system
              to maintain the confidentiality of both the reporter and the
              children involved.

          <p>To protect the privacy of children in the images submitted:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Face blurring/pixelation option:</strong> We provide a
              tool that allows you to blur or pixelate the faces of children in
              the images you submit. This helps prevent the identification of
              children while still allowing authorities to assess the situation
              and take necessary action.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pre-submission safety:</strong> Before submitting an
              image, we strongly encourage you to use this tool to ensure the
              protection of the children's identity.

            <li>
              <strong>Data storage:</strong> We take appropriate technical and

            <li>
              <strong>No exploitation:</strong> We do not condone the use of
              images that exploit or harm children in any way. Images should
              only be submitted if they are directly relevant to reporting
              suspected child labor.

              reports are investigated. This may include sharing information you
              submit, such as images and case details, with relevant
